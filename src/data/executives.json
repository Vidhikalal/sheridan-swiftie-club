    "description": "Hi, I'm Benafsha! Currently enrolled in the Public Relations program working towards becoming a PR pro who loves connecting with people and creating positive vibes. When I'm not studying, you'll probably find me with a book, checking out new restaurants, or planning my next trip. Oh, and I'm a huge Taylor Swift fanâ€”I start my day with songs from the Reputation album and end the day with Midnights! I feel like I'm definitely between the Reputation and Midnights eras. Reputation speaks to me because it's all about reclaiming your power and owning who you are. On the other hand, Midnights feels dreamy, representing those late-night thoughts and reflections about growth, love, and uncertainty. Both eras together just feel like the perfect mix of strength and self-discovery right now! I'm looking forward to meeting fellow Swifties and bonding over our favorite Taylor Swift songs this fall term! I'm excited for the themed events or album listening parties we might have and just sharing all Eras love. Plus, it'll be great to make new connections with people who share the same passion! What about you?"
